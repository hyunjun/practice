# missing integer

* Task description
  * given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
  * For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
  * For another example, given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
  * Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
  * Assume that:
    * N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
  * Complexity:
    * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
    * expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
    * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
